@rem Creates a leaf cert key pair signed with a designated intermediate cert.
@rem
@rem IMPORTANT: For non-test purposes the key must be protected - do NOT
@rem check into source control, instead place on a USB stick that is kept offline
@rem except for rare cases where it is used to install the certificate.
@rem
@rem Usage: CreateLeaf "Subject String" "IntermediateBaseFilename" "BaseFilename"
@rem E.g.: CreateLeaf "localhost" TestSiteIntermediate TestSite
@rem Expects IntermediateBaseFilename.PrivateKey.pem and IntermediateBaseFilename.Cert.pem generated
@rem by CreateIntermediate.cmd to be in the current directory.

@rem Assumes OpenSSL-Win64 is installed from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
@rem The "light" version is sufficient. Install binaries into the bin\ directory, not System32.

@rem Create a cert chain of all but the root cert for TLS serving - root cert must be trusted on devices,
@rem but the server should serve its leaf and intermediate. Particularly important for Android where the
@rem "Settings->Security->Install From SD Card" only allows installing a root cert into the user trusted store.
