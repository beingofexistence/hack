**Solve all your logging and logout problems** üîê

Hack is an open source library that makes it easy to implement secure logging and logout functionality in your web applications. It provides a variety of features, including:

* User authentication and authorization
* Session management
* Password hashing and salting
* Logging and auditing
* CSRF protection
* Logout prevention

Hack is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing applications. It is also highly extensible, so you can customize it to meet your specific needs.

**Getting started**

To get started with Hack, simply install the package:

```
npm install hack
```

Once Hack is installed, you can create a new user account:

```
const hack = require('hack');

const user = await hack.createUser({
  username: 'my_username',
  password: 'my_password',
});
```

Once you have a user account, you can log them in:

```
const token = await hack.login(user);
```

You can then use the token to authenticate the user and access their account data.

To log the user out, simply call the `logout()` function:

```
hack.logout();
```

**Features**

Hack provides a variety of features to help you implement secure logging and logout functionality in your web applications. These features include:

* **User authentication and authorization:** Hack provides a built-in authentication and authorization system that allows you to control who can access your application and its resources.
* **Session management:** Hack provides a session management system that allows you to track users' login status and keep them logged in even if they close their browser.
* **Password hashing and salting:** Hack uses bcrypt to hash and salt passwords, which makes them much more secure against attack.
* **Logging and auditing:** Hack provides a logging and auditing system that allows you to track all user activity in your application.
* **CSRF protection:** Hack provides built-in CSRF protection to help prevent malicious attacks.
* **Logout prevention:** Hack provides logout prevention to help prevent users from being logged out accidentally.

**Extensibility**

Hack is highly extensible, so you can customize it to meet your specific needs. For example, you can create your own authentication and authorization providers, add support for additional social login services, or implement custom logging and auditing logic.

**Contributing**

Hack is an open source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you have any suggestions or bug fixes, please feel free to create a pull request.

**Support**

If you need help using Hack, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub. We will be happy to assist you.

# hack
A simple and powerful logging library for Python.

## Features
- Easy to use: just import the library and start logging with one line of code.
- Customizable: you can configure the log level, format, handler, and output destination.
- Flexible: you can create multiple loggers with different settings and use them in different modules.
- Reliable: you can handle exceptions and errors gracefully and log them with stack traces.
- Compatible: you can use the library with any Python version from 2.7 to 3.9.

## Installation
You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install hack
```

Or you can clone the repo and install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/hack.git
cd hack
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
To use the library, you need to import it and create a logger object:

```python
import hack
logger = hack.Logger()
```

Then you can use the logger methods to log messages with different levels:

```python
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

By default, the messages will be printed to the standard output (console) with the following format:

```
[2023-10-21 01:05:22] [DEBUG] This is a debug message
[2023-10-21 01:05:22] [INFO] This is an info message
[2023-10-21 01:05:22] [WARNING] This is a warning message
[2023-10-21 01:05:22] [ERROR] This is an error message
[2023-10-21 01:05:22] [CRITICAL] This is a critical message
```

The format consists of four parts: the timestamp, the log level, the module name, and the message. You can customize the format by passing a string to the `format` parameter when creating the logger object:

```python
logger = hack.Logger(format="%(message)s")
```

The string can contain any of the following placeholders:

| Placeholder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| %(asctime)s | The date and time of the log event |
| %(levelname)s | The name of the log level |
| %(module)s | The name of the module where the log event occurred |
| %(message)s | The log message |

You can also change the log level by passing a string or an integer to the `level` parameter when creating the logger object:

```python
logger = hack.Logger(level="INFO")
```

The valid log levels are:

| Level | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| DEBUG | 10 |
| INFO | 20 |
| WARNING | 30 |
| ERROR | 40 |
| CRITICAL | 50 |

The logger will only log messages that have a level equal or higher than the specified level. For example, if you set the level to "INFO", then only messages with "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "CRITICAL" levels will be logged.

You can also specify a different output destination for the log messages by passing a file object or a file name to the `output` parameter when creating the logger object:

```python
logger = hack.Logger(output="log.txt")
```

This will write the log messages to a file named "log.txt" in the current directory. You can also use any file-like object that supports writing, such as `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.

If you want to use more than one output destination, you can use the `add_handler` method to add additional handlers to the logger object:

```python
logger.add_handler(hack.FileHandler("log.txt"))
logger.add_handler(hack.StreamHandler(sys.stderr))
```

A handler is an object that receives log messages from a logger and writes them to a specific destination. The library provides two built-in handlers: `FileHandler` and `StreamHandler`. You can also create your own custom handlers by subclassing the `BaseHandler` class and overriding its `write` method.

If you want to remove a handler from the logger object, you can use the `remove_handler` method:

```python
logger.remove_handler(handler)
```

You need to pass the handler object that you want to remove as an argument.

If you want to handle exceptions and errors in your code and log them with stack traces, you can use the `exception` method of the logger object:

```python
try:
    # some code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception(e)
```

This will log the exception message and the stack trace with the "ERROR" level. You can also pass a custom message as an optional argument:

```python
logger.exception(e, "Something went wrong")
```

This will log the custom message followed by the exception message and the stack trace.
